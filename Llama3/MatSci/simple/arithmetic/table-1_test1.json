    "Answer": "0.33",
    "QuestionType": "comparison",
    "TableName": "table-1",
    "Explanation": "The atomic percentage of Co in ICP-AES method is 20.01 and the atomic percentage of Cr is 19.68. The percentage difference is calculated as ((20.01 - 19.68) / 19.68) * 100 = 0.33.",

    "QuestionType": "average",
    "TableName": "table-1",
    "Explanation": "The atomic percentages of Fe, Mn, and Ni in the Nominal method are all 20. The average is calculated as (20 + 20 + 20) / 3 = 20.",
