    "Answer": "0.211",
    "QuestionType": "comparison",
    "TableName": "table-1",
    "Explanation": "The atomic radius of Ti is 1.462, and the atomic radius of Co is 1.251. The difference is calculated by subtracting the smaller value from the larger value.",

    "QuestionType": "average",
    "TableName": "table-1",
    "Explanation": "The atomic radii of Ti and Zr with VEC of 4 are 1.462 and 1.603, respectively. The average is calculated by adding the values and dividing by 2.",

    "QuestionType": "average",
    "TableName": "table-1",
    "Explanation": "The atomic radii of Co and Ni are less than 1.300. Their VEC values are 9 and 10, respectively. The average is calculated by adding the values and dividing by 2.",
