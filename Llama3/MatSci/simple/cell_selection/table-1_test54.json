    "Answer": "1.391",
    "QuestionType": "calculation",
    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The average atomic radius is calculated by summing up the atomic radii of all elements and dividing by the number of elements. The sum of atomic radii is 7.581 and the number of elements is 6, so the average atomic radius is 7.581/6 = 1.391.",
