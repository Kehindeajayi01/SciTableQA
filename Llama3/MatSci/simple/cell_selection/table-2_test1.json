    "Answer": "304L stainless steel powder",
    "QuestionType": "Cell comparison",
    "TableName": "table-2.csv",
    "Explanation": "The i_corr values for CoCrFeMnNi powder and 304L stainless steel powder are 0.6300 and 0.6971, respectively. Since 0.6971 is greater than 0.6300, 304L stainless steel powder has a higher i_corr value.",

    "TableName": "table-2.csv",
    "Explanation": "The average E_corr value can be calculated by adding the E_corr values for both materials and dividing by 2: (-0.6485 + -0.7280) / 2 = -0.68825.",
