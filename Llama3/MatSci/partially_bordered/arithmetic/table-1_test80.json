    "Answer": "0.258",
    "QuestionType": "Comparison",
    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The difference is calculated by subtracting the \u0394S_min value of Si0.05 (13.668) from that of Si0.1 (13.926)",

    "Answer": "25.5%",
    "QuestionType": "Percentage increase",
    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The percentage increase is calculated by subtracting the \u0394H_min value of Si0.2 (-16.07) from that of Si0.4 (-20.32) and dividing by the former, then multiplying by 100",

    "Answer": "1445.77",
    "QuestionType": "Average",
    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The average is calculated by summing the T_m values of the first three rows (1445.80 + 1445.44 + 1445.08) and dividing by 3",

    "Answer": "1.8%",
    "QuestionType": "Percentage decrease",
    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The percentage decrease is calculated by subtracting the VEC MD value of Si0.5 (8.00) from that of Si0.4 (8.07) and dividing by the former, then multiplying by -100",
