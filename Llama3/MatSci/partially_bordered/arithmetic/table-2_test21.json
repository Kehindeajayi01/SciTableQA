    "Explanation": "To calculate the average value of φi for elements with a φi value greater than 0, we first identified the elements with φi > 0 (Co, Ni, Cu). Then, we calculated the average of their φi values (1.2510 + 1.2459 + 1.2780) / 3 = 0.33.",

    "TableName": "table-2.csv",
    "Explanation": "To calculate the difference between the φi value of Al and the φi value of Fe, we subtracted the φi value of Fe (1.2412) from the φi value of Al (1.4317), resulting in 0.1905.",
