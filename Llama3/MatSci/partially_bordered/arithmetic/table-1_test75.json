    "Answer": "25.94",
    "QuestionType": "average",
    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The average percentage of Ti is calculated by summing up the Ti percentages in rows 0 and 1 (24.46 and 25.26) and dividing by 2.",

    "Answer": "13.18",
    "QuestionType": "comparison",
    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The percentage of Zr in alloy P is 33.64 and in alloy D is 35.95. The difference is 35.95 - 33.64 = 2.31. Since the question asks for the difference, the answer is 2.31.",

    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The percentages of V and Nb in alloy Ti1.5ZrVNb are 22.85 and 18.80 respectively. The sum is calculated by adding these two values.",

    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The percentage of Ti in alloy Ti2ZrVNb is 40.59 and in alloy 0 is 24.46. The difference is 40.59 - 24.46 = 16.13. Since the question asks for the percentage difference, the answer is 16.13/24.46 = 0.6615 or approximately 5.13%.",
