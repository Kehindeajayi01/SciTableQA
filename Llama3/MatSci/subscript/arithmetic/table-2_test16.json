    "TableName": "Alloys Sintering temperature (°C) Grain size (nm)  Ref.",
    "Explanation": "The average sintering temperature of the alloys with grain size greater than 600 nm is calculated by taking the average of the sintering temperatures of rows 1, 3, and 4, which are 1200, 1200, and 1150 respectively.",

    "Answer": "900",
    "QuestionType": "comparison",
    "TableName": "Alloys Sintering temperature (°C) Grain size (nm)  Ref.",
    "Explanation": "The difference in sintering temperature is calculated by subtracting the smallest grain size (327 nm) from the largest grain size (1050 nm), which results in a difference of 723 nm. The corresponding sintering temperatures are 1200°C and 1200°C respectively, resulting in a difference of 0°C.",
