    "Question": "What is the average hardness value for the first 3 samples, and how does it compare to the average hardness value for the last 3 samples?",
    "Answer": "5925 \u00b1 84 vs 5934 \u00b1 144",
    "QuestionType": "Comparison",
    "TableName": "table-3.csv",
    "Explanation": "The average hardness value for the first 3 samples is calculated by averaging the values in cells 1, 2, and 3 (5925, 5765, and 5959). Similarly, the average hardness value for the last 3 samples is calculated by averaging the values in cells 4, 5, and 6 (5979, 5999, and 5728).",

    "Question": "What is the difference in hardness value between the 1st and 2nd samples, and what is the corresponding Rockwell hardness value?",
    "Answer": "5925 - 5765 = 160, HRC 59",
    "QuestionType": "Arithmetic",
    "TableName": "table-3.csv",
    "Explanation": "The difference in hardness value is calculated by subtracting the value in cell 2 (5765) from the value in cell 1 (5925). The corresponding Rockwell hardness value is obtained from cell 1 (HRC 59).",
    "GT": "160 HV"

    "QuestionType": "Comparison",
    "TableName": "table-3.csv",
    "Explanation": "The average Rockwell hardness value for all samples is obtained from cell 6 (58\u00b12). The average Rockwell hardness value for the first half of the samples is calculated by averaging the values in cells 1, 2, and 3 (59, 59, and 59).",

    "Answer": "5925 \u00b1 84 vs 5976 \u00b1 95",
    "QuestionType": "Comparison",
    "TableName": "table-3.csv",
    "Explanation": "The average hardness value for the samples with a Rockwell hardness value of 59 is calculated by averaging the values in cells 1, 3, and 5 (5925, 5959, and 5917). The average hardness value for the samples with a Rockwell hardness value of 58 is calculated by averaging the values in cells 2, 4, and 6 (5765, 5979, and 5728).",

    "Answer": "6096 - 5728 = 368, HRC 60 - HRC 54 = 6",
    "QuestionType": "Arithmetic",
    "TableName": "table-3.csv",
    "Explanation": "The range of hardness values is calculated by subtracting the minimum value (5728) from the maximum value (6096). The range of Rockwell hardness values is calculated by subtracting the minimum value (54) from the maximum value (60).",
