    "Explanation": "The question asks for the average yield strength of samples with plastic strain greater than 4%. To answer this, we need to filter the rows with plastic strain greater than 4% (rows 3 and 4) and then calculate the average yield strength. The result is 1272 \u00b1 50 MPa.",

    "TableName": "table-3.csv",
    "Explanation": "The question asks for the difference in ultimate strength between the sample with the lowest yield strength (Re293) and the sample with the highest yield strength (Re1273). The difference is calculated as 1932 \u00b1 50 (Re1273) - 1000 \u00b1 50 (Re293) = 458 \u00b1 50 MPa.",

    "QuestionType": "Comparison",
    "TableName": "table-3.csv",
    "Explanation": "The question asks for the average yield strength of samples with ultimate strength within 50 MPa of the average ultimate strength. The average ultimate strength is (1000 \u00b1 50 + 1320 \u00b1 50 + ... + 1932 \u00b1 50) / 5 = 1565 MPa. We then filter the rows with ultimate strength within 50 MPa of 1565 MPa (rows 1, 2, and 3) and calculate the average yield strength. The result is 1281 \u00b1 50 MPa.",
