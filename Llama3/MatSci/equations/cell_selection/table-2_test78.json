    "Answer": "Re673",
    "QuestionType": "cell selection",
    "TableName": "table-2.csv",
    "Explanation": "The answer can be found by comparing the values in the column '\u03bcA/cm2' across all samples. The highest value is found in the second row, corresponding to the sample 'Re673'.",

    "Answer": "4.92",
    "QuestionType": "calculation",
    "TableName": "table-2.csv",
    "Explanation": "The average value of R_s can be calculated by summing the values in the column 'R_s' and dividing by the number of samples. The sum of R_s values is 1.9 + 12.8 + 7.1 + 1.5 + 1.6 = 24.9, and dividing by 5 samples gives an average value of 4.92.",
