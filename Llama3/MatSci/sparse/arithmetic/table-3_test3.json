    "Answer": "0.14",
    "QuestionType": "Comparison",
    "TableName": "Unknown_1",
    "Explanation": "The Wigner-Seitz radius for Ti is 1.63 and for V is 1.49, so the difference is 1.63 - 1.49 = 0.14",

    "QuestionType": "Average",
    "TableName": "Unknown_1",
    "Explanation": "The Wigner-Seitz radii for the elements in the row labeled 'HfNbTaTiZr' are 1.67, 1.70, 1.66, 1.70, and 1.66. The average is (1.67 + 1.70 + 1.66 + 1.70 + 1.66) / 5 = 1.67",

    "TableName": "Unknown_1",
    "Explanation": "The Wigner-Seitz radius for Mo is 1.55 and for Nb is 1.62, so the difference is 1.62 - 1.55 = 0.07",
