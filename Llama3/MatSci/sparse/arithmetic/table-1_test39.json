    "Question": "What is the average percentage of Ti in the alloy samples that have a higher Nb content compared to those with a lower Nb content?",
    "Answer": "24.4 ± 0.2",
    "QuestionType": "comparison",
    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The question compares the Ti content in rows with higher Nb content (NbTiZr, NbTiZrV, NbTiZrVMo, NbTiZrVTa, NbTiZrVCr) to those with lower Nb content (Particles, Bright spots, Dendrites, Channels, GB particles, Bright phase, Dark phase, Needles, GB layer). The average Ti content in the higher Nb content rows is calculated as (24.4 ± 0.2).",
    "GT": "Ti with higher Nb content: 26.9 ± 0.2, Ti with lower Nb content: 19.8 ± 0.3 "
