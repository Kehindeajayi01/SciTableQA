    "Explanation": "The average Nb content in the reacted zone is calculated by taking the average of the Nb values in cells 1 and 4, which is (37.4 + 40.4) / 2 = 38.9. The average Nb content in the metal core is calculated by taking the average of the Nb values in cells 0 and 3, which is (76.0 + 66.5) / 2 = 71.25. The percentage difference is calculated as ((71.25 - 38.9) / 71.25) * 100% = 64.7%",
