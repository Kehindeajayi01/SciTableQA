    "QuestionType": "average",
    "TableName": "Mixing enthalpies of binary atomic pairs",
    "Explanation": "The average enthalpy of mixing is calculated by summing up all the enthalpy values and dividing by the number of pairs, which is 15 (6 elements taken 2 at a time).",

    "Answer": "Co",
    "QuestionType": "comparison",
    "TableName": "Mixing enthalpies of binary atomic pairs",
    "Explanation": "The enthalpy of mixing between Ti and Co is -35, which is the highest among all the elements.",
    "GT": "(Zr or Hf if the highest is on numerical scale, zero is higher than -35. If absolute value of the numbers then Ni)"

    "QuestionType": "sum",
    "TableName": "Mixing enthalpies of binary atomic pairs",
    "Explanation": "The sum is calculated by summing up the enthalpy values for Ti with each of the other elements: -28 + -35 + -9 + 0 + 0 = -82.",
