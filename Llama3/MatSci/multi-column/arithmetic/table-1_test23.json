    "QuestionType": "Comparison",
    "TableName": "table-1",
    "Explanation": "The average volume fraction of B2 phase is calculated by averaging the values in cells 1 and 5, which are 69\u00b12 and 64\u00b11 respectively, and then averaging the Al content in cells 1 and 5, which are 22.2% and 19.5% respectively. The result is 52.5\u00b11.5.",
