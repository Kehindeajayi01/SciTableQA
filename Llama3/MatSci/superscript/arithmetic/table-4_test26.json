    "Question": "What is the average density of the alloys in the table, and how does it compare to the density of alloy 7?",
    "Answer": "8.45 g/cm³, which is slightly higher than the density of alloy 7 (8.4 g/cm³)",
    "QuestionType": "comparison",
    "TableName": "table-4.csv",
    "Explanation": "The average density was calculated by summing the densities of all alloys and dividing by the number of alloys. The comparison was made by referencing the density of alloy 7.",

    "QuestionType": "comparison",
    "TableName": "table-4.csv",
    "Explanation": "The average elongation at break was calculated by summing the elongations at break of all alloys and dividing by the number of alloys. The comparison was made by referencing the elongation at break of alloy 2.",

    "TableName": "table-4.csv",
    "Explanation": "The total number of alloys was counted by summing the number of rows in the table. The average yield strength of the alloys with a density greater than 9 g/cm³ was calculated by summing the yield strengths of alloys 3, 5, and 6 and dividing by 3.",
