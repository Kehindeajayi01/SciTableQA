    "Question": "What is the difference in Ti content between the Particle and Needles samples?",
    "Answer": "20.5",
    "QuestionType": "Comparison",
    "TableName": "table-2.csv",
    "Explanation": "The Ti content for Particle is 59.4, and for Needles is 36.5, so the difference is 59.4 - 36.5 = 20.5",

    "Answer": "13.2",
    "QuestionType": "Average",
    "TableName": "table-2.csv",
    "Explanation": "To calculate the average Nb content, we add up the Nb values (4.2 + 37.0 + 68.0) and divide by the number of samples (3), resulting in 13.2",

    "Answer": "1.84",
    "QuestionType": "Ratio",
    "TableName": "table-2.csv",
    "Explanation": "The N content for Particle is 35.9, and for Needles is 19.5, so the ratio is 35.9 / 19.5 = 1.84",

    "QuestionType": "Sum",
    "TableName": "table-2.csv",
    "Explanation": "To calculate the total Fe content, we add up the Fe values (0.3 + 2.3 + 2.4), resulting in 5.0",

    "QuestionType": "Comparison",
    "TableName": "table-2.csv",
    "Explanation": "The Mo content for Needles is 4.7, and for Matrix is 9.6, so the difference is 9.6 - 4.7 = 4.9",
