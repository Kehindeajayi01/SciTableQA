    "Answer": "6.14",
    "QuestionType": "average",
    "TableName": "table-5.csv",

    "Answer": "3.96",
    "QuestionType": "difference",
    "TableName": "table-5.csv",
    "Explanation": "The alloy with the highest compressive strain is AlCoCrFeNi with 22.7% and the alloy with the lowest compressive strain is NbMoTaW with 2.6%. The difference in density is calculated by subtracting the density of NbMoTaW (13.75) from the density of AlCoCrFeNi (7.00).",
