    "Answer": "1.51",
    "QuestionType": "average",
    "TableName": "table-1",
    "Explanation": "The average atomic radius is calculated by adding the atomic radii of all elements and dividing by the number of elements: (1.43 + 1.28 + 1.27 + 1.40 + 1.60) / 5 = 1.51",

    "QuestionType": "average",
    "TableName": "table-1",
    "Explanation": "The average density is calculated by adding the densities of all elements and dividing by the number of elements: (2.70 + 8.96 + 7.87 + 7.40 + 1.74) / 5 = 4.63",
