    "Answer": "23",
    "QuestionType": "Comparison",
    "TableName": "table-3.csv",
    "Explanation": "The change in melting point from 600\u00b0C to 800\u00b0C is 386 - 375 = 11. The same calculation is done for each alloy to get the average change of 23.",

    "Answer": "243.33",
    "QuestionType": "Average",
    "TableName": "table-3.csv",
    "Explanation": "The average melting point is calculated by summing the melting points at 1200\u00b0C, 1400\u00b0C, and 1600\u00b0C (337, 264, and 148) and dividing by 3.",
