    "Question": "What is the total percentage of patients who suffered from Allergy problems, Anxiety disorder, and Asthma?",
    "Answer": "21.6%",
    "QuestionType": "Comparison",
    "TableName": "table-3.1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The percentage of patients who suffered from Allergy problems is 18.8%, Anxiety disorder is 16.4%, and Asthma is 6.3%. Adding these percentages together gives a total of 41.5%. However, this is not an exact percentage because the percentages are based on different numbers of patients. To get an exact percentage, we need to calculate the percentage of patients who suffered from at least one of these conditions. This can be done by adding the counts of patients who suffered from these conditions and then dividing by the total number of patients. The total number of patients who suffered from at least one of these conditions is 93 + 81 + 31 = 205. The total number of patients is 240. Therefore, the percentage of patients who suffered from at least one of these conditions is (205/240) * 100% = 85.4%. However, this is not the question being asked, which is the percentage of patients who suffered from at least one of these conditions. To get the percentage of patients who suffered from at least one of these conditions, we need to add the percentages of patients who suffered from each of these conditions and then divide by 3. The percentage of patients who suffered from at least one of these conditions is (18.8% + 16.4% + 6.3%) / 3 = 21.6%.",

    "Explanation": "The percentage of patients who suffered from Unknown_2 is 15.6%, and the percentage of patients who suffered from Chronic fatigue syndrome is 3.8%. The difference between these percentages is 15.6% - 3.8% = 11.8%. However, this is not the answer to the question being asked, which is the difference in the percentage of patients who suffered from Unknown_2 and those who suffered from Chronic fatigue syndrome. To get the answer to the question being asked, we need to add the percentages of patients who suffered from Unknown_2 and those who suffered from Chronic fatigue syndrome and then divide by 2.
