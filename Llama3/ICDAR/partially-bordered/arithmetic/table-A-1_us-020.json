    "Answer": "98.33",
    "QuestionType": "average",
    "TableName": "table-A-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The average weighted school participation rate before substitution is calculated by summing the weighted school participation rates of the top 3 performing education systems (Alberta-CAN, Ontario-CAN, and Quebec-CAN) and dividing by 3.",
