    "QuestionType": "Comparison",
    "TableName": "table-6.csv",
    "Explanation": "The average body weight of male rats at Postnatal Day 14 is calculated by averaging the values in cells (5, 3) and (5, 2), which are 31 and 5.8, respectively.",

    "Answer": "100.0%",
    "QuestionType": "Comparison",
    "TableName": "table-6.csv",
    "Explanation": "The percentage change in body weight is calculated by subtracting the value in cell (11, 2) from the value in cell (9, 2), then dividing by the value in cell (9, 2), and multiplying by 100. The result is 100.0%.",
