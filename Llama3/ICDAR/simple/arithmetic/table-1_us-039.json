    "Answer": "65",
    "QuestionType": "average",
    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The average Wildlife Criterion for birds is calculated by summing up the values for Kingfisher (33), Loon (82), Osprey (82), and Bald eagle (100) and dividing by 4.",

    "Answer": "43",
    "QuestionType": "comparison",
    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The highest value in the table is 100 (Bald eagle) and the lowest value is 33 (Kingfisher). The difference between these two values is 100 - 33 = 43.",

    "Answer": "57",
    "QuestionType": "median",
    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "To find the median, we need to arrange the values in order: 33, 42, 57, 82, 82, 100. Since there are an odd number of values, the middle value is the median, which is 57.",

    "QuestionType": "range",
    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The range of Wildlife Criterion values for birds is calculated by subtracting the lowest value (33) from the highest value (100), which gives a range of 100 - 33 = 69.",
