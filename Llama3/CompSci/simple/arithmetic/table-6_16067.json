    "Answer": "10.4",
    "QuestionType": "Comparison",
    "TableName": "table-6.csv",
    "Explanation": "The validation accuracy for 'DecompAtt' is 75.4 and for 'Ngram' is 65.0, so the difference is 75.4 - 65.0 = 10.4",

    "Answer": "73.4",
    "QuestionType": "Calculation",
    "TableName": "table-6.csv",
    "Explanation": "The average of the test accuracies for DecompAtt (72.3), ESIM (70.6), and DGEM (77.3) is (72.3 + 70.6 + 77.3) / 3 = 73.4",

    "QuestionType": "Comparison",
    "TableName": "table-6.csv",
    "Explanation": "The test accuracy for 'DGEM' is 77.3 and for 'Majority class' is 60.3, so the difference is 77.3 - 60.3 = 16.9",
