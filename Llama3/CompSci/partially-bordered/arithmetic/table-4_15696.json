    "TableName": "table-4.csv",
    "Explanation": "The difference between the MRR values of the studies published in 2016 and 2015 is calculated by subtracting the average MRR value of the studies published in 2015 (0.7932) from the average MRR value of the studies published in 2016, which is (0.8447 + 0.8511 + 0.8770 + 0.8886) / 4 = 0.8367.
