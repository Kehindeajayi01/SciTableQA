    "Answer": "ln(6.4)",
    "QuestionType": "calculation",
    "TableName": "table-1",
    "Explanation": "The average differential privacy level is calculated by taking the average of the differential privacy levels of the selected users, which is (ln(2) + ln(4) + ln(6) + ln(8)) / 4 = ln(6.4)",

    "Answer": "0.6667",
    "QuestionType": "comparison",
    "TableName": "table-1",
    "Explanation": "The proportion of users with a differential privacy level greater than the threshold is calculated by dividing the number of users with a differential privacy level greater than 0.7 by the total number of users, which is (3/4) = 0.6667",
