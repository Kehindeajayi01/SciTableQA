    "Answer": "+2.8",
    "QuestionType": "Comparison",
    "TableName": "Unknown_1",
    "Explanation": "The average performance of the Bilinear-gated model is 90.8 \u00b1 0.1, while the Baselines model is 88.0 \u00b1 0.1. The difference is calculated by subtracting the Baselines model's average performance from the Bilinear-gated model's average performance.",
