    "Answer": "0.008",
    "QuestionType": "comparison",
    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The average difference is calculated by subtracting the PED values of the RS-PED method from the PED values of the PED method and then averaging the results.",

    "Answer": "0.045",
    "QuestionType": "comparison",
    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The methods with a PCS value greater than 0.45 are PCE, RS-PCE, PCS (Jin, Segovia, and S\u00fcsstrunk 2016), and RS-PCS. The average PCE value is calculated by summing the PCE values of these methods and dividing by the number of methods.",

    "Answer": "0.162",
    "QuestionType": "comparison",
    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The methods with a PED value greater than 0.17 are PED, RS-PED, PCE, RS-PCE, PJS, RS-PJS, PCS (Jin, Segovia, and S\u00fcsstrunk 2016), RS-PCS, PKL (Wang et al. 2017), and RS-PKL.
