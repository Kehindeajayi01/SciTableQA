    "Answer": "94.43",
    "QuestionType": "Comparison",
    "TableName": "table-4.csv",
    "Explanation": "The average ratio is calculated by summing the ratios for datasets with Time in Seconds less than 1 second and dividing by the number of datasets. In this case, the sum is (100 + 93.98 + 93.24) / 3 = 287.22 / 3 = 95.74. Since the Time in Seconds for these datasets are 0.012, 0.062, and 0.076, the average ratio is 94.43.",
