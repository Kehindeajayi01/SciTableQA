    "Answer": "2.04",
    "QuestionType": "average",
    "TableName": "Unknown_1",
    "Explanation": "The average SDR for 'Vocal' is (2.05 + 2.25) / 2 = 2.15, and for 'Bass' is (1.33 + 2.81) / 2 = 2.07. The average of these two values is 2.04.",

    "QuestionType": "difference",
    "TableName": "Unknown_1",
    "Explanation": "The average SIR for 'Drum' is (2.12 + 3.27) / 2 = 2.69, and for 'Other' is (1.57 + 1.87) / 2 = 1.72. The difference is 2.69 - 1.72 = 0.51.",
