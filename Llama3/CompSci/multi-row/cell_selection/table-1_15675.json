    "Answer": "2.21",
    "QuestionType": "cell selection and calculation",
    "TableName": "table-1",
    "Explanation": "The answer can be found by calculating the average of the SDR values in the table, which are 1.62, 2.05, 1.33, 2.25, 2.12, 2.18, 1.57, 1.24, 1.77, and 1.87. The average is (1.62 + 2.05 + ... + 1.87) / 10 = 2.21",
