    "Answer": "6.46",

    "Explanation": "Using the equations from Hankins and Howe [7] (CPcarc = 5.98+0.66xCPRS) and Costa e Silva et al [12] (CPcarc = 18.38+0.16xCPRs-0.20xOV), we can calculate the CPcarc values for xCPRS = 10. For Hankins and Howe [7], CPcarc = 5.98 + 0.66*10 = 19.58. For Costa e Silva et al [12], CPcarc = 18.38 + 0.16*10 - 0.20*xOV (assuming xOV is 0 since it's not provided).

For CPcarc, CPcarc = 18.38 + 0.16*5 - 0.20*3 = 19.28. For EEcarc, EEcarc = 4.54 + 0.48*5 + 0.12*3 = 8.64. The sum is 19.28 + 8.64 = 23.92.",
