    "QuestionType": "calculation",
    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The total length of the forward primer is calculated by summing up the number of characters in each primer sequence. For the UGT1A1 region, the forward primer sequences are GAAACCTAATAAAGCTCCACCTTC, TCATTTAAAGGGACCACGCC, ACGTAGTGCATACACCCTTG, and GAAACAGGTTTCCTTTCCCAAG. The total length is 34 characters.",

    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The average length of the reverse primer is calculated by summing up the number of characters in each primer sequence and dividing by the number of sequences. For the UGT1A1 region, the reverse primer sequences are TTGCTCAGCATATATCTGGGGC, GGAAAAGCCAAATCTAAGGTTCC, GAAACAACGCTATTAAATGCTACG, and CAGAGGGGGCACGATACATA.

    "Explanation": "The longest forward primer is GAAACCTAATAAAGCTCCACCTTC with 34 characters, and the shortest forward primer is TCATTTAAAGGGACCACGCC with 24 characters. The difference in length is 34 - 24 = 10 characters.",

The number of sequences with an 'A' character in the reverse primer is 3 (GGAAAAGCCAAATCTAAGGTTCC, GAAACAACGCTATTAAATGCTACG, and CAGAGGGGGCACGATACATA).
