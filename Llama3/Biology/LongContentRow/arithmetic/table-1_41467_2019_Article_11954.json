    "QuestionType": "comparison",
    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The effect sizes for the SNPs on TAG(52:3;0) are calculated by subtracting the Ref allele effect from the Alt allele effect. The top 10% of SNPs with the highest effect sizes are then averaged to get the average effect.",
