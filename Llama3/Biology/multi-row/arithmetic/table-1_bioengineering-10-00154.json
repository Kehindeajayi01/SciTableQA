    "QuestionType": "Comparison",
    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The percentage of cases with a known OMIM number is calculated by dividing the number of rows with a non-NaN OMIM number (23) by the total number of rows (25) and multiplying by 100.",

    "TableName": "table-1.csv",
    "Explanation": "The average number of genes associated with autosomal recessive cases is calculated by summing the number of genes for each AR case (NOP10, NHP2, WRAP53, PARN) and dividing by the number of AR cases (4).",
